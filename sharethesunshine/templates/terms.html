    <h2 class="lead">Terms and Conditions for Buck O'Hairen's Legendary Sunshine&copy;'s Share the Sunshine Promotion</h2>

    <div class="description">
    <p>Thank you for your desire to Share The Sunshine with your friends and loved ones.  Our lawyers forced us to put together these Terms and Conditions, so take a minute or two to read this information to make sure you agree with what it says.  Here are some important things to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Every promotion has rules, and Share The Sunshine has rules.  If you don't feel comfortable with the rules contained in these Terms and Conditions, please do not click on the "Share the Sunshine" button on the Promotion's website -- it really is that simple.</li>
        <li>Use your head when you draft your personalized message.  If your message is threatening, offensive, or breaks the law, we'll deny your order.  Don't even think of confessing to or attempting to plan a crime in your message.  Also, don't come crying to us if your message creates bad karma for you.</li> 
        <li>We only ship Legendary Sunshine速 to the Lower 48.  Don't ask us to deliver to Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Tibet, or Antarctica.</li>
        <li>Give us 7-10 days to deliver your order to the recipient, and we'll do our best to get it there on time.</li>
        <li>We fill your order, we ship it, and that's all we do.   Once the delivery company takes your order, they're on the hook for whatever happens next.  If your can of Legendary Sunshine速 is damaged on the road to its destination, that's between you and the delivery company.  However, we do want to hear about delivery problems you may encounter.</li> 
        <li>If you think something has gone wrong, don't sue us over the $5 you spent.  Let us know about any problems you have, and we'll try to make it right.</li>
        <li>Knowledge is power, so be sure to read all of the important information below before you place you order.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>ALL TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHARE THE SUNSHINE PROMOTION ("THE PROMOTION") ARE GOVERNED BY THE SHARE THE SUNSHINE PROMOTION  TERMS AND CONDITIONS ("TERMS AND CONDITIONS").

    <ol>

Sunshine Beverages' acceptance of your offer to purchase is subject to these Terms and Conditions.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT CLICK ON THE "ADD TO WAGON" LINK ON THE PROMOTION'S WEBSITE.</li>
